                        <!-- <h3>Project Info</h3> -->
                        <p>Hi :)! I'm honored to be back as President for 2020-20201 school year! I'm on my last year of
                            my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. After being involved in various team projects and
                            working as a software engineer intern, I realized my passion is more in product development
                            rather than in coding.
                            I had a little exposure to coding when I was in high school. During my first-year at UBC, I
                            felt isolated because there weren't a lot of womxn in my class and I didn't have anything in
                            common with my male classmates. I wanted to make new CS friends but back then we didn't have
                            a womxn community here.
                            My vision for this year is to create events catered to empower underrepresented minorities
                            in the technology industry. I want to establish a permanent place for woxmen in CS at UBC,
                            where womxn can empower and support each other at times where they feel a bit lost. Other
                            than establishing a CS community at UBC, this year I am aiming for outreach programs for
                            female* high school students, letting them know there is plenty of space for them in the
                            technology and engineering fields.</p>

                        <!-- <h3>Project Info</h3> -->
                        <p>Hello!
                            I am in my third-ish year of my computer science originally hailing from Minnesota, USA. I
                            have been on co-op since January 2020 - working remotely since March 2020 - at Clir
                            Renewables through a science co-op.
                            I wanted to be an exec because I have been looking for a community like WiCS, for womxn in
                            computer science because I am one! I found my first two years in UBC Computer Science a bit
                            isolating being a female in the faculty, but being part of this group has been really nice
                            knowing there are others like me in the field!
                            I originally wanted to be in engineering at UBC but soon realized that I enjoyed coding a
                            lot (and also taking less classes and more electives was a good idea :wink: ).
                            Outside of computer science, I enjoy going on big bike rides (I just finished a 2 week bike
                            touring trip on Vancouver Island), cooking, baking bread, hiking, kayaking, and skiing in
                            winter. I am also involved with the UBC Climate Hub and serve as their representative on the
                            AMS Sustainability Subcommittee.</p>

                        <p>My name is Parinaz (Paris) Khoramziadeh and I am the marketing coordinator/volunteer for the
                            WiCS. I come from an interesting background, having the opportunity to try different majors
                            such as Engineering, Biology and sciences, I finally found my dream and passion for robotics
                            and programming. I am a Psychology and Mathematicians major switching to CS and Math and my
                            goal is to help people all over the world through technology and A.I. I aspire to help and
                            uplift them by crafting machines and robots that will make their lives much easier. My love
                            for robotics started when I competed in an international event designed for providing a
                            platform for hard working students with big dreams. I felt accomplished and proud to have
                            been selected among my other peers as representatives from my school and it was that moment
                            when I realized that I can use my talents and creativity in such a meaningful and empowering
                            way. I look forward to contributing my knowledge and ideas to WiCS and CODE in order to
                            continue the legacy of all the amazing role models in the STEM field who have paved the way
                            for us and inspired many to follow their dreams and create a fun, informative and equitable

                        <!-- <h3>Project Info</h3> -->
                        <p>Hi I'm Paulette, a first year master's student working on type-preserving compilation of
                            dependent types with Professor WIlliam J. Bowman. I'm from a tiny town in Indiana, USA, and
                            I decided to pursue computer science at Indiana University because I was inspired by my
                            older sister who is a software developer. During my time at IU, I got really interested in
                            programming languages theory and research, and that's how I ended up at UBC. I plan to
                            pursue my PhD at UBC as well and become a professor of computer science. I'm especially
                            motivated because I never had a female professor teach me a computer science course whose
                            research area was programming languages! Furthermore, as I got farther along in my degree, I
                            found that I was the only woman in my computer science courses. By being a part of UBC Women
                            in CS, I hope to help foster a nurturing and encouraging environment for all women
                            interested in computer science. I definitely wouldn't be where I am today without some of my
                            female friends in my intro courses in computer science, and I hope that UBC Women in CS can
                            be an additional support network for women outside the classroom!</p>

                        <p>I first fell in love with coding in a high school computer science course. I loved how it
                            challenged me to think in different ways, and the satisfaction I found in solving a complex
                            problem is one of the most rewarding feelings ever. At the same time as I fell in love with
                            coding, I also found environmental science. The pressing issue of climate change encouraged
                            me to combine majors in computer science and environmental science, in hopes of bridging the
                            gap between the tech industry and climate research. I’m in my second year now, with plans to
                            graduate in 2023 after my co-op work terms. I am so excited to be apart of the WiCS board, I
                            see this group as an opportunity to help other women find their passions in university and
                            build a supportive environment within the computer science department, and I hope that by
                            planning fun and informative events I can help us can achieve these goals!</p>

                        <!-- <h3>Project Info</h3> -->
                        <p>Before I enrolled in the BCS program at UBC, I worked as a game marketer and business
                            strategist. To complete my lifetime goal, I quitted my job and went to world travel. By
                            then, I decide to change my career to a software engineer that has more flexibility.
                            When I join the computer science world, I noticed that the CS community has less diversity,
                            especially in 3rd and 4th-year courses. I have seen many female friends choose the other
                            majors when they have finished in 1st or 2nd-year CS courses. I was terrified, and I always
                            felt I am not the right person to be in the classroom.
                            However, I have met a good female mentor, and she gave me the confidence to resist, and I
                            slowly started to trust my self. After I won some prizes from hackathons, I realized that I,
                            womxn, have enough ability but do not have much confidence.
                            Like my mentor, I hope to grow our community and, ultimately, help young students who are
                            intimidating to dive into the computer science world. As a part of womxn in the computer
                            science community, I believe we should be work together to foster our community.</p>

                        <p>How’s it going? I’m Jossie, and I’m the designer for WiCS! I actually didn’t know about this
                            group until the end of my first year when I discovered it through the CS department email.
                            When I attended my first CPSC class, it wasn’t hard to see that a large majority were men,
                            and I felt very conscious of that, especially as someone with no prior computer science
                            knowledge. I wish I had discovered WiCS sooner, as I really wanted to get to know fellow
                            women
                            in CS. Now that I’m one of the executives in the group, I hope to help strengthen and grow
                            the bond between all women in CS! I currently don’t have a major, but I’m hoping to get into
                            cognitive systems with the computer science focus, in the faculty of science. For me I love
                            CS because it is the perfect combination of creativity and problem solving, which I
                            find challenging and exciting. Some of my hobbies include learning new languages, eating
                            food
                            (I’m a huge foodie), and illustrating of course!</p>

                        <p>Before studying Computer Science at UBC, I was a student at the University of Calgary
                            studying Biological Sciences and Sociology. I worked in a Cancer Epidemiology lab at the
                            time and it was here that I was first exposed to the work that programmers and data
                            scientists were performing to help make everyone else's work operate more smoothly. After
                            obtaining my BSc. and BA, I decided I wanted to learn how to code and develop software
                            myself and so I decided to enroll in the Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS) after-degree
                            program at UBC. I wanted to join UBC WICS as soon as I heard about it because I want to help
                            foster a more collaborative and supportive community of computer science students of all
                            genders at UBC. I have found that being able to seek out and surround myself with other
                            women in tech, has made me feel supported and capable and this has made all the difference
                            in my ability to learn and take advantage of the many opportunities the CS department
                            offers.</p>

                            Hi! I’m Kavya, a fifth-year Combined Major: Computer Science & Statistics student who’s
                            currently working as a Data Analyst Intern at EA (Electronic Arts). Throughout my years at
                            UBC, I have attended a handful of WiCS/CODE events (especially in my first year) which have
                            inspired me to major in CS. In my final year, I wanted to give back and join WiCS as an
                            executive so that I could work with other WiCS members to organize and host a variety of
                            events throughout the year to inspire other first-year students to major in CS, and to give
                            all womxn CS students a space in our growing community to feel comfortable. In addition to
                            my love for coding and data, I enjoy playing and listening to music (I play the flute,
                            ukulele, and I sing), and I’m a member of UBC’s fusion music club Sargam.
