                Hey! I'm Chloe, a fourth(ish) year combined computer science and
                environmental science major. I have been involved with WiCS
                since it started in 2019 as event director, and I am so excited
                to be president this year. Computer science excites me because I
                see it as a tool for solving complex problems, such as those
                caused by the climate crisis. Outside of WiCS, I enjoy hiking
                and skiing and am also on the Varsity Outdoor Club exec as
                Social Coordinator. I joined WiCS with the goal of creating a
                welcoming and supportive environment for women in the computer
                science department. As we return to campus in the coming year, I
                am excited to start hosting in-person events again and continue
                building our community!

                Hi, I'm Carina, a third-year student, and am currently on my
                first co-op work term! I first fell in love with computer
                science after having taken it as an elective with no previous
                plans to pursue it as a career, but I loved how it challenged me
                to critically think and be creative! I plan to graduate in 2023
                and become a software developer. By joining UBC Women in CS, I
                want to help foster a supportive environment for all women
                studying or interested in computer science by building a strong
                professional network of women working in the industry. Without
                the help of my female friends, I wouldn't have made it through
                my computer science courses alone. I hope UBC WiCS can provide a
                strong community for women in tech, who may feel intimidated and
                are scared by the lack of gender diversity.

                Hi! I’m Sarah, a second-year student studying Computer Science,
                Statistics, and Business Management. During my first year at
                UBC, I didn’t know what I wanted to specialize in but I sparked
                a passion for CS. I didn’t have much exposure or experience with
                CS before beginning my studies at UBC and I felt like I was late
                to the game. I decided to join WICS because I wanted to be a
                part of a community where I could help others discover their
                passion for CS like I did. I am excited to work with others who
                share a similar passion and be in an environment where we can
                support and encourage the development of each other! Some of my
                other passions include learning and leadership and I enjoy going
                on adventures with friends, trying out new food spots, and
                baking. I am thrilled to be a part of the WICS team and can’t
                wait to help grow this empowering community.

                Hi, I’m Ireena, a third-year Computer Science major. I ended up
                learning about this club pretty late into my undergrad since I
                transferred to UBC from an international university. Moving to a
                new country in the middle of the academic year during a pandemic
                left me with very little time to get involved with clubs.
                Finding out about this club inspired me to be of help to my
                fellow women in this field which is why I decided to finally
                join the club. To be able to communicate with other parties as
                an external director, hold events and give back and foster this
                community leaves me motivated and happy. A few years into my
                undergrad, I realized that I am more inclined towards UX/UI
                design and project management rather than software development
                or coding, in general. Other than that, I love drawing, writing
                and I am learning two languages (Japanese and Korean) at the
                moment!

                Hi, I am Iris! I am entering my second year at UBC as a
                Mathematics student, with the intention to double major in
                Computer Science. I went to high school in Port Moody, BC.
                Sometime in grade 9, I was introduced to computer science
                through a girls' coding workshop and have since developed my
                passion in the subject area whilst working on some simple
                programming projects. Throughout high school, I have been
                involved in several CS-related outreach activities, including
                partnering with CanCode to host coding workshops for
                girls/underrepresented communities and working with AI4Youth to
                host educational conferences for youth to learn more about AI
                technology. I am thrilled to be part of the executive team for
                WiCS. I want to help encourage diversity and provide more
                opportunities for women* in computing science and I hope we can
                create an inviting space that inspires more women* to pursue CS.

                Hi there! I’m Yeojun and I’m entering my second year of Computer
                Science and Statistics! After spending my first year entirely on
                Canvas and Zoom, I am thrilled to be back as treasurer this
                year. Last year, I was a part of UBC Women in Computer Science
                as a First-Year Representative and Marketing Director (and loved
                it), and I wanted to try something new. Through WiCS, I’ve made
                so many valuable connections and helped many first-year students
                feel at home with our social events - and I would love to do it
                again. My goal as a WiCS executive is to create a supportive
                network amongst other women in computer science where we
                socialize, share resources, and stand for diversity. In my free
                time, I like to go for sunset drives and food adventures! I’m
                excited to show you what our team can carry out this year :)

                Hi there! I’m Emily! I am joining the WiCS team for the first time as Webmaster. I am a 4th-year student in the Bachelor of Computer Science program. My journey to computer science is a bit unique. With a previous degree in education, it took some time for me to discover my passion for coding! In 2020 I decided to transition careers from teaching to computer science and I have loved every minute of it. I am so excited to be on this journey and to learn and grow as a computer scientist alongside some pretty incredible women. I joined the WiCS team in order to help foster a community of women who share a common interest and passion for computer science.

               Hi there! My name is Pranipa Ernest and I’m the WiCS Designer for the 2021/2022 school year. I’m a computer science major who’s just finished my first year of the BCS program. Prior to enrolling in computer science, I had completed a bachelor’s degree in Biochemistry at McMaster University where I also acted as a graphic designer for a couple of clubs. My main goal as the WiCS Designer is to encourage and support other women who are interested in the tech field. With my designs I hope to promote diversity within CS by helping to create a network that is both welcoming and exciting. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have anything you want to chat about, whether it be questions about WiCS, design, CS, etc!

               Hi! My name is Jasvir and I’m entering my second year at UBC. WiCS played a major role in my transition to UBC after transferring from a smaller university in BC. This club created a sense of community for me, which I was missing in the midst of transferring during a pandemic. My interest in computer science grew after taking my first computer science course at UBC. What I found I liked most about CS was the challenging yet rewarding aspects that came with solving complex problems. After attending different CS events and getting the opportunity to speak to different women working in the field, I was sure I wanted to major in CS. I noticed I received multiple comments from both friends and family about my decision to pursue a degree in a male-dominated field. As an executive, my goal is to help other women not feel discouraged by the lack of gender diversity and create a strong support system outside of the classroom. I’m so excited to be a part of this year’s executive team and be able to give back to a wonderful community of powerful women.
