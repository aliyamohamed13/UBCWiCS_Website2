                Hey! I'm Chloe, a fourth(ish) year combined computer science and
                environmental science major. I have been involved with WiCS
                since it started in 2019 as event director, and I am so excited
                to be president this year. Computer science excites me because I
                see it as a tool for solving complex problems, such as those
                caused by the climate crisis. Outside of WiCS, I enjoy hiking
                and skiing and am also on the Varsity Outdoor Club exec as
                Social Coordinator. I joined WiCS with the goal of creating a
                welcoming and supportive environment for women in the computer
                science department. As we return to campus in the coming year, I
                am excited to start hosting in-person events again and continue
                building our community!

                Hi I'm Paulette, a first year master's student working on
                type-preserving compilation of dependent types with Professor
                WIlliam J. Bowman. I'm from a tiny town in Indiana, USA, and I
                decided to pursue computer science at Indiana University because
                I was inspired by my older sister who is a software developer.
                During my time at IU, I got really interested in programming
                languages theory and research, and that's how I ended up at UBC.
                I plan to pursue my PhD at UBC as well and become a professor of
                computer science. I'm especially motivated because I never had a
                female professor teach me a computer science course whose
                research area was programming languages! Furthermore, as I got
                farther along in my degree, I found that I was the only woman in
                my computer science courses. By being a part of UBC Women in CS,
                I hope to help foster a nurturing and encouraging environment
                for all women interested in computer science. I definitely
                wouldn't be where I am today without some of my female friends
                in my intro courses in computer science, and I hope that UBC
                Women in CS can be an additional support network for women
                outside the classroom!

                I first fell in love with coding in a high school computer
                science course. I loved how it challenged me to think in
                different ways, and the satisfaction I found in solving a
                complex problem is one of the most rewarding feelings ever. At
                the same time as I fell in love with coding, I also found
                environmental science. The pressing issue of climate change
                encouraged me to combine majors in computer science and
                environmental science, in hopes of bridging the gap between the
                tech industry and climate research. I’m in my second year now,
                with plans to graduate in 2023 after my co-op work terms. I am
                so excited to be apart of the WiCS board, I see this group as an
                opportunity to help other women find their passions in
                university and build a supportive environment within the
                computer science department, and I hope that by planning fun and
                informative events I can help us can achieve these goals!

              <p>
                Before I enrolled in the BCS program at UBC, I worked as a game
                marketer and business strategist. To complete my lifetime goal,
                I quitted my job and went to world travel. By then, I decide to
                change my career to a software engineer that has more
                flexibility. When I join the computer science world, I noticed
                that the CS community has less diversity, especially in 3rd and
                4th-year courses. I have seen many female friends choose the
                other majors when they have finished in 1st or 2nd-year CS
                courses. I was terrified, and I always felt I am not the right
                person to be in the classroom. However, I have met a good female
                mentor, and she gave me the confidence to resist, and I slowly
                started to trust my self. After I won some prizes from
                hackathons, I realized that I, women*, have enough ability but
                do not have much confidence. Like my mentor, I hope to grow our
                community and, ultimately, help young students who are
                intimidating to dive into the computer science world. As a part
                of women* in the computer science community, I believe we should
                be work together to foster our community.

                How’s it going? I’m Jossie, and I’m the designer for WiCS! I
                actually didn’t know about this group until the end of my first
                year when I discovered it through the CS department email. When
                I attended my first CPSC class, it wasn’t hard to see that a
                large majority were men, and I felt very conscious of that,
                especially as someone with no prior computer science knowledge.
                I wish I had discovered WiCS sooner, as I really wanted to get
                to know fellow women in CS. Now that I’m one of the executives
                in the group, I hope to help strengthen and grow the bond
                between all women in CS! I currently don’t have a major, but I’m
                hoping to get into cognitive systems with the computer science
                focus, in the faculty of science. For me I love CS because it is
                the perfect combination of creativity and problem solving, which
                I find challenging and exciting. Some of my hobbies include
                learning new languages, eating food (I’m a huge foodie), and
                illustrating of course!

                Before studying Computer Science at UBC, I was a student at the
                University of Calgary studying Biological Sciences and
                Sociology. I worked in a Cancer Epidemiology lab at the time and
                it was here that I was first exposed to the work that
                programmers and data scientists were performing to help make
                everyone else's work operate more smoothly. After obtaining my
                BSc. and BA, I decided I wanted to learn how to code and develop
                software myself and so I decided to enroll in the Bachelor of
                Computer Science (BCS) after-degree program at UBC. I wanted to
                join UBC WICS as soon as I heard about it because I want to help
                foster a more collaborative and supportive community of computer
                science students of all genders at UBC. I have found that being
                able to seek out and surround myself with other women in tech,
                has made me feel supported and capable and this has made all the
                difference in my ability to learn and take advantage of the many
                opportunities the CS department offers.

                Hi! I’m Kavya, a fifth-year Combined Major: Computer Science &
                Statistics student who’s currently working as a Data Analyst
                Intern at EA (Electronic Arts). Throughout my years at UBC, I
                have attended a handful of WiCS/CODE events (especially in my
                first year) which have inspired me to major in CS. In my final
                year, I wanted to give back and join WiCS as an executive so
                that I could work with other WiCS members to organize and host a
                variety of events throughout the year to inspire other
                first-year students to major in CS, and to give all women* CS
                students a space in our growing community to feel comfortable.
                In addition to my love for coding and data, I enjoy playing and
                listening to music (I play the flute, ukulele, and I sing), and
                I’m a member of UBC’s fusion music club Sargam.

                Hey! I’m in my first year of science at UBC and I’m planning to
                major in computer science! Starting my anticipated university
                experience entirely online, I found it challenging to find new
                friends and connections outside of class. I found it even more
                difficult to find female classmates in computer science courses,
                especially those who would walk through a journey alongside me
                in this major. For these exact reasons, I joined UBC’s WiCS to
                meet fellow women* with a similar level of interest and
                commitment to computer science. Although online, having a
                welcoming community for women* in CS like me helps me feel much
                more motivated and less isolated already! My interest in
                programming took off in high school and led me to start a
                self-led simple game development last year. I am delighted to be
                a first-year representative for WiCS and stand for diversity in
                this area! Most importantly, I would like to encourage every
                student, especially first-year students, to reach out to
                available resources and get involved!
